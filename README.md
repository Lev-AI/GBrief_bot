# GlobalBrief  
**Telegram bot:** @GBrief_bot

GlobalBrief is a production-grade Telegram bot designed for deep contextual analysis of information streams. It reads content from Telegram channels in **any source language** and produces structured analytical overviews in the **user’s selected language**.

> **Note**  
> This repository contains a **high-level architectural overview** of a private production system.  
> Implementation details, internal logic, and operational parameters are intentionally omitted.

## 🎯 What Problem It Solves

Telegram is one of the very few large-scale platforms where information flows with minimal centralized moderation. As a result, it contains a **broad, diverse, and often contradictory set of perspectives** on global events — including viewpoints that may be absent from traditional or heavily moderated media platforms.

At the same time, this openness creates a significant challenge: high signal is mixed with noise, repetition, and fragmented narratives.

GlobalBrief addresses this by helping users:
- navigate large volumes of unstructured Telegram content
- understand **what is actually happening**, not just what is being posted
- compare perspectives across multiple channels and viewpoints
- follow complex topics **across languages** without relying on a single information source

## 🧠 High-Level System Architecture

GlobalBrief is designed as a **multi-stage analytical system**, not a simple summarization bot.

At a conceptual level, the system consists of:

- **Ingestion Layer**  
  Collects messages from multiple Telegram channels and information streams.

- **Context Aggregation Layer**  
  Groups and aligns messages by semantic relevance and temporal context.

- **Analytical Processing Layer**  
  Identifies key topics, trends, and emerging narratives across sources.

- **Narrative Synthesis Layer**  
  Produces structured, human-readable analytical summaries.

- **Presentation Layer**  
  Delivers results in the **user’s chosen language**, independent of source language.

The architecture is designed to support:
- multilingual input and output
- configurable analysis depth
- controlled resource and cost management
- extension toward advanced analytical modes

### Architecture Scale & Complexity

GlobalBrief is not a single-script bot or a prompt wrapper.

At the current stage, the system includes:
- approximately **30 internal modules**, each responsible for a clearly separated concern
  (ingestion, filtering, context building, analysis, orchestration, and output formatting)
- **two analytical pipelines**:
  - one active production pipeline used for real-time analysis
  - one advanced pipeline currently under development
- **5,000+ lines of production code**, excluding experiments, drafts, and documentation

The architecture is designed for incremental evolution, allowing new analytical stages,
models, and orchestration logic to be added without breaking existing behavior.

## 🌍 Multilingual by Design

A core design principle of GlobalBrief is **language decoupling**:

- source content may be in **any language**
- analytical output is generated in the **user’s selected language**
- language consistency is enforced at the system level

This enables users to consume and analyze global information flows without language barriers.

---

## 👥 Intended Use Cases

GlobalBrief is designed for users who require **context rather than raw data**:

- Journalists and media researchers
- OSINT and geopolitical analysts
- Market and policy observers
- Content creators tracking global narratives
- Users following events outside their native language

---

## 🧱 Architecture Philosophy

The system is built around the following principles:

- **Context over raw messages**
- **Structured output over free-form text**
- **Controlled analytical pipelines over ad-hoc prompting**
- **Configurability without exposing internals**
- **Production safety over experimental flexibility**

---

## 🔒 Project Status

GlobalBrief is a **private production system** currently running in **real-world beta testing with active users**.

The system is already used to analyze live Telegram channels and generate multilingual analytical summaries in production conditions.

The next planned phase is a **commercial deployment**, including expanded access modes and additional analytical capabilities.

This public repository intentionally does **not** include:
- source code
- internal pipelines
- prompts or models
- configuration files or thresholds

The purpose of this repository is to document the **concept, architecture, and design approach** behind the system.
